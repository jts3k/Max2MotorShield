# Max2MotorShield

Software for controlling the [Adafruit Motorshield v2](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438) via [Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) or [Max-for-Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/).  This just sets the speed and direction of the four DC motor outputs but doesn't control servos or steppers.
